# Reverse proxy nginx letsencrypt tutorial
In this tutorial, we set up a reverse proxy with NGINX and trusted HTTPS certificates from letsencrypt. We will install it directly on a Linux server and expose a sample web application.

We will use the free and open-source Web Server NGINX.

## Prerequisites

- Linux Server running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer

You can still install Nginx on a Linux Server that is not running Ubuntu, however, this may require different commands!

## Installation and Configuration

1. Install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install nginx
```

After you have installed NGINX, you can find the configuration files in the `/etc/nginx` folder.

2. Use NGINX as a reverse proxy

To enable the reverse proxy feature in NGINX, we will create a new **default** configuration file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory.

Note, you should never allow direct access to your app, otherwise, users could possibly just bypass the reverse proxy. I’ve changed the listening address from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`, that our app is only accepting connections from localhost.

```nginx
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        server_name research.the-digital-life.com;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        }
}
```

The `proxy_pass` argument will forward all incoming client requests to this server to our app. You can easily change the protocol, IP, or port to whatever your app or website is listening to.

3. (optional) Additional arguments

If you want to specify further arguments, you can do this within the `server {}` section or directly in the `location / {}` section. For example, I will add the `proxy_set_header` directive to pass the Host-Header which may be required by some apps or websites exposed by the proxy.

```nginx
location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

4. Add trusted SSL Certificates from Letsencrypt

Now, let’s obtain trusted HTTPS certificates for our application. It’s also best practice to redirect all unencrypted HTTP connections to HTTPS. This is relatively easy with certbot and letsencrypt certificates. The certbot will obtain free certificates and also handle the renewal process automatically. To do that we will install certbot and also a plugin for our NGINX server.

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Once we have installed those packages, we can obtain our certificates.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d research.the-digital-life.com
```

It will ask you if you want to redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS. Select yes (2). This automatically makes some changes to our NGINX default configuration.

```nginx
server {

  server_name research.the-digital-life.com;
 
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
  }

    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/research.the-digital-life.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/research.the-digital-life.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = research.the-digital-life.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  server_name research.the-digital-life.com;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

5. (optional) Test auto-renewal

```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
```
